# Introducing: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Course

We're excited to announce the launch of our comprehensive course on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics! This cutting-edge educational platform is designed to take students from ROS2 fundamentals to autonomous humanoid systems.

## What You'll Learn

Our 4-module course covers everything you need to know about building intelligent humanoid robots:

- **Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)** - Learn about ROS 2 architecture, nodes, topics, services, and actions
- **Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)** - Simulation environments, physics, and virtual testing
- **Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)** - Perception, SLAM, navigation, and AI behavior
- **Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)** - Linking speech, vision, LLMs to robot actions

## Why Humanoid Robotics?

Humanoid robots represent the next frontier in robotics and AI. They require integration of multiple complex systems including perception, planning, control, and interaction. Our course provides the knowledge and practical skills needed to build these sophisticated systems.

## Interactive Learning Experience

Unlike traditional robotics courses, ours is fully interactive with hands-on tutorials, code-ready instructions, and step-by-step pipelines. Students can follow along with real examples and see immediate results in simulation.

## Capstone Project

The course culminates with a comprehensive capstone project where students build an autonomous humanoid robot capable of responding to voice commands and executing complex tasks.

Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to enhance this educational platform!
